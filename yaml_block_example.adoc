This is an example of a procedure with a yaml code block that does not convert correctly.

. blah blah
. Check each outdated VMI to determine whether it is live-migratable:
+
[,bash]
----
$ kubectl get vmi <vmi> -o yaml
----
+
Example output:
```yaml
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1
kind: VirtualMachineInstance
...
  status:
 conditions:

 ** lastProbeTime: null
lastTransitionTime: null
message: cannot migrate VMI which does not use masquerade to connect to the pod network
reason: InterfaceNotLiveMigratable
status: "False"
type: LiveMigratable
```
